STARTUP
-------------------------------------------------------
Just open the text.html file to start. If you have chrome, it should just open a new tab/window
in chrome, but I'm not sure what will happen for other browsers.

Hey quick notes for what's going on in these files
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Cards
Each card is clickable, so when you click the card to make your choice, the next page containing
the next part of the story will load.
I also think that the design of the cards is good because I feel like photo to go with the options
adds a bit more flair and personality to the design.

2. Layout
I personally think that this layout works the best (text on left followed by the cards).
We can change the card and text size accordingly to get everything looking good.

3. Folder
I can cleanup the folder containing all the folders, just dump all the stuff in there for now
while we're still working on it.

4. What now?
I'm thinking that each page will contain the story/context of the choices as well as the choices
in card format. Once a user makes their choice, they will click on the card and then the next part
of the story will load.
